For the assignment, you will have to do the following, create the files: form.html, login.html and styles.css. The “form.html” is the same as the one I uploaded, but you will have to apply styles using the file “styles.css”. When the user clicks on the button of the form, the browser should display the document “login.html”. The page “login.html” should have the fields “username” and “password”. You will have to apply styles as well using the file “styles.css” or other CSS file for that purpose (as you prefer). If you have any question, please feel free to post it on the channel. Happy Friday, thanks!
